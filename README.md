# Repository
A repository in GitHub is like a folder for your project. It contains all the files, including the project's code, documentation, and other resources. It enables version control, collaboration among team members, and easy tracking of changes to the project.

# Brance

A branch in GitHub is a separate line of development that allows you to work on a feature or fix without affecting the main project. It helps in parallel development and experimentation before changes are merged into the main codebase.
